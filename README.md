# Project Title: Melbourne Housing Market Analysis

## Description

This project provides an analysis of Melbourne's housing market using real estate data. It includes a dataset containing information about various properties sold in Melbourne and a Jupyter notebook performing data analysis and machine learning tasks, particularly using **RandomForestRegressor** and **XGBoost** for predicting house prices.

### Files:

1. **melb_data.csv**: 
   - A dataset containing 13,580 entries with 21 attributes describing different properties sold in Melbourne. 
   - Key columns:
     - `Suburb`: The suburb where the property is located.
     - `Address`: The street address of the property.
     - `Rooms`: Number of rooms in the property.
     - `Type`: Type of property (e.g., house, unit).
     - `Price`: Sale price of the property (target variable for predictions).
     - `Date`: Sale date.
     - `Distance`: Distance to the central business district (CBD).
     - `Landsize`: The land size of the property.
     - `BuildingArea`: The size of the building area.
     - `YearBuilt`: Year the property was built.
     - `Lattitude` and `Longtitude`: Coordinates of the property.
     - And more (including other geographic and market-related information).

2. **Notebook 1.ipynb**:
   - A Jupyter notebook that loads the dataset and applies machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on the **RandomForestRegressor** and **XGBoost** models.
   - The notebook uses Python libraries such as:
     - `pandas`: For data manipulation and cleaning.
     - `scikit-learn`: For splitting the data, preprocessing, and applying machine learning algorithms.
     - `XGBoost`: For implementing the gradient-boosting decision tree method for regression.
     - The notebook includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison of performance between models.

## Machine Learning Models Used

### 1. **RandomForestRegressor**

**RandomForestRegressor** is an ensemble learning method that is widely used for regression tasks. It works by building multiple decision trees during training and averaging the results for more accurate and stable predictions.

#### How It Works:
- The algorithm builds multiple decision trees on random subsets of the data.
- Each tree is trained on a random sample of the data and random subsets of features at each split.
- The final prediction is the average of all the individual tree predictions (in the case of regression).

#### Why Use RandomForestRegressor:
- **Handles non-linearity**: Can model complex relationships without requiring the data to be linear.
- **Robust against overfitting**: Since multiple trees are used, it tends to be more generalizable than a single decision tree.
- **Feature importance**: Provides an understanding of which features are most influential in predicting the target variable.

#### Key Parameters:
- `n_estimators`: The number of trees in the forest. Higher numbers improve accuracy but increase computational cost.
- `max_depth`: The maximum depth of the trees. Controlling depth prevents overfitting.
- `random_state`: Ensures reproducibility of the results.

In this project, **RandomForestRegressor** is used to predict property prices based on the dataset features. It's particularly good for this task because:
- The housing data contains a mix of continuous and categorical variables.
- RandomForest handles missing data well and provides good generalization with minimal tuning.

### 2. **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)**

**XGBoost** is a highly efficient and scalable implementation of gradient-boosting decision trees. It’s popular due to its performance in various data science competitions and is known for its speed and accuracy.

#### How It Works:
- **Boosting**: It builds trees sequentially, where each new tree corrects the errors of the previous trees.
- **Weighted Voting**: Each tree "votes" on the prediction, but unlike RandomForest, XGBoost assigns higher weights to observations that are harder to predict.
- **Learning Rate**: A parameter that controls how much the model is influenced by each tree. Smaller values of the learning rate make the training process slower but often result in better models.

#### Why Use XGBoost:
- **Highly Accurate**: Known for delivering state-of-the-art results in a wide range of regression and classification problems.
- **Regularization**: Includes L1 and L2 regularization to reduce overfitting, making it more robust than traditional decision trees.
- **Efficient**: Uses techniques such as tree pruning and sparsity-aware computation, making it faster and more memory-efficient.

#### Key Parameters:
- `n_estimators`: Number of boosting rounds (trees) to fit.
- `learning_rate`: Shrinks the contribution of each tree to prevent overfitting.
- `max_depth`: Maximum depth of each tree.
- `gamma`: Controls whether a given node will split based on the expected reduction in loss after the split.

In this project, **XGBoost** is applied to predict house prices and compared with the results from **RandomForestRegressor**. **XGBoost** typically provides better performance due to its boosting approach, which corrects the errors of previous models, but it may require more tuning.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy xgboost
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook (`Notebook 1.ipynb`):
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Notebook 1.ipynb"
   ```

3. Run the cells to:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Perform data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature selection.
   - Train the models (`RandomForestRegressor` and `XGBoost`).
   - Compare model performance (e.g., mean squared error or R² scores).

## Dataset Overview

| Column        | Description                                             |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `Suburb`      | The suburb where the property is located.               |
| `Rooms`       | Number of rooms in the property.                        |
| `Price`       | Sale price of the property (target variable).           |
| `Date`        | Sale date of the property.                              |
| `Distance`    | Distance to the central business district (CBD).        |
| `Landsize`    | Land size of the property in square meters.             |
| `BuildingArea`| Building area in square meters.                         |
| `YearBuilt`   | The year the property was built.                        |
| `Regionname`  | General location of the property within Melbourne.      |
| And more...   | Additional features such as `CouncilArea`, `SellerG`, `Method` used for the sale, and more. |

## Model Evaluation

Both models, **RandomForestRegressor** and **XGBoost**, will be evaluated based on their predictive performance. The notebook may include metrics such as:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average of the squares of the errors between predicted and actual prices.
- **R² Score**: Represents the proportion of variance explained by the model. A higher score indicates a better fit.

The comparison will allow you to determine which model is more suitable for predicting Melbourne house prices.
